In a dataset with 630,894 credit card transactions, 383 of them are fraud (0.061% of total). Total transaction amount is $102 billion, with $101.83 billion in normal transactions and $338 million in fraudulent ones. The average normal transaction amount is $161,501, while fraudulent transactions average $881,588. Transactions involve four types: Cash out, Transfer, Cash In, and Debit.
Fraudulent activities are notably prevalent during specific time intervals, with the morning and night presenting the highest risk,
followed by the evening and afternoon. The morning and night also see the most and largest fraudulent transactions, respectively. To safeguard against potential fraud, it is crucial to exercise heightened caution when conducting transactions during these peak-risk periods. Verifying and double-checking transaction details becomes particularly important during these times.
The second table reveals that night time transactions carry a significant risk, with 112 transactions amounting to a staggering 126 million in fraudulent activity. This underscores the need to be especially vigilant
when engaging in high-value transactions during night time hours. Payment methods fall into four categories, but only two of
them, namely Transfer and Cash Out, are responsible for the majority of fraud incidents, constituting 51% and 49% of fraudulent transactions, respectively.
Furthermore, the amounts involved in fraudulent transactions for these two methods are approximately equal. To minimize the risk of falling victim to fraud, it is advisable to avoid using these payment types whenever possible,
particularly until security measures are strengthened. Should you find it necessary to use these methods, always exercise extra caution and meticulously verify all transaction details before proceeding. Staying aware of these trends and taking proactive measures can help protect your financial transactions from potential fraud.
